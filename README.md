  The mention feature has some drawbacks: 
          1) If users type emails in the content, it will not be displayed properly (can be improved if I have more time, but I don't think people will type emails these days) 
          2) No autocomplete when you type the usernames (if you want this, you have to sacrifice perfermance because you need to load ajax, as well as some MySQL queries.)
