  Drawbacks: 
          1) If users type emails in the content, it will not display properly (can be improve if I have more time, but I don't think people will type emails in here) 
          2) No autocomplete when you type the usernames (if you want this, you have to sacrifice perfermoance because you need to load ajax, as well as some MySQL queries

}
